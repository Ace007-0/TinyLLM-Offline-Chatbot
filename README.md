# TinyLLM-Offline-Chatbot
This is a lightweight offline chatbot interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that interacts with a locally hosted **TinyLLM** model using HuggingFace Transformers. It allows users to input questions and receive responses from a locally fine-tuned language model — without needing an internet connection once the model is downloaded.
